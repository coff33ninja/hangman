     - Create a storyline with characters and events tied to the riddles and words.
     - Use the AI to generate story elements dynamically.

---

### 11. **AI-Generated Categories**
   - **Feature**: Allow the AI to dynamically create new categories for words and riddles based on patterns in the data.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use clustering algorithms or natural language processing (NLP) to analyze word definitions and group them into new categories.
     - Update the `load_words` and `load_riddles` methods to support AI-generated categories.

---

### 12. **Educational Integration**
   - **Feature**: Use the game as an educational tool for vocabulary building, language learning, or even teaching riddles.
